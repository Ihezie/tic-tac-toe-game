## Overview

### Project Description

A web version of the popular tic-tac-toe game, featuring two modes: human vs human and human vs computer. In human vs human mode, players are able to:
- Choose their own icons (x always goes first)
- Input their names to be displayed on the scoreboard
In the human vs computer mode, the single player is able to:
- Choose their own icon (x always goes first)
- Select a difficulty level from easy, medium and impossible

### What I learned

I learned a boatload of things from this project. I improved my CSS layout skills, learned the difference between shallow copying and deep copying, and most importantly, learned how to program a minimax algorithm to determine the best move for an AI to make in a game. This algorithm was quite tough to implement – as I had to learn about game trees, recursion, and a bunch of other things – but I am proud to say I was able to figure it out.

### Continued Development

I plan to take a more organized approach to completing future projects. One of the challenges I faced in completing this project was the need to restructure the entire codebase whenever I wanted to add new features. To address this issue in future projects, I will ensure that I develop a solid outline detailing all the necessary steps before I begin coding.
