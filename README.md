# TIC TAC TOE GAME

## Game Outline

- The first component rendered should be a welcome page containing the game title and options to choose whether to play against the computer or a human.
- Each time a player wins, a modal declaring the win should be displayed. The specifics of this modal are described in the design images.
- This is not in the design, but there should be a round count in included in the app.
- The "quit" and "reset" button both format the game.

## Confusing Concepts I Encountered During the Project

- The `Array()` constructor and `map()` function.
- `export default` with arrow functions.
